# samvadsetu | संवाद-सेतु

Simple LLM API for commonly used LLM services including Gemini, ChatGPT, and Ollama. The name implies a bridge for dialogue since the library facilitates communication and interaction between a programs logic and the large language models capabilities. The sanskrit word saṃvāda (संवाद) refers to dialogue, and setu (सेतु) means bridge.
